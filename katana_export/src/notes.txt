THINGS TO LOOK AT TOMORROW (17/05)
https://fenicsproject.org/qa/4000/constructing-subdomains-from-knowing-indices-cells-the-mesh/
- constructing subdomains from the mesh data rather than via a logical expression defining the boundary
- could be useful for creating MeshRestriction from the mesh data from Gmsh

katana/pbs notes

https://hpc.research.uts.edu.au/getting_started/running/
on creating unique scratch directory per job.



https://unsw-restech.github.io/using_katana/about_katana.html,
UNSW Katana has local scratch $TMPDIR (local to node or to job?; I think it's local to the node)
https://docs.hpc.qmul.ac.uk/storage/usingtmp/


-------------------------
Installing anaconda, setting up virtual envs and coping packages to katana...?

from scratch:
conda env export > environment.yml # encodes the environment on the local machine
conda env create -f environment.yml # creates envirnoment on the second machine

updating environment:

e.g.
Install meshio on local machine using conda:
conda install -c conda-forge meshio
